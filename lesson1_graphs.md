## Principles of analytic graphics

- Show comparison
- Show causality, mechanism, explanation
- Show multivariate data
- Integrate multiple modes of evidence
- Describe and document the evidence
- Content is king

## Characteristics of exploratory graphs

- They are made quickly
- A large number are made
- The goal is for persoanal understanding
- Axes/legends are generally cleaned up
- Color/size are primarily used for information

## Simple summaries of data

### one dimension
- Five-number summary
- Boxplots
- Histograms
- Density plot
- Barplot
### two dimensions
- Scatter plot
- Multiple/overlayed 1-D plots (Lattice/ggplot2)
- Smooth scatterplots
### > 2 dimensions
- Overlayed/multiple 2-D plots; coplots
- Use color, size, shape to add dimensions
- Spinning plots
- Actual 3-D plots (not that useful)
